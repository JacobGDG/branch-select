# Why?
A small rust project to experiment with Rust, because, apparently everything
needs oxidising these days. Also I miss programming.

As part of this I am experimenting with Nix, particularly how to create dev
environments with it. There seems to be a big DevEx benefits to Nix, so this is
my space to give it a try I dont want to install rust dev on my host machine, I
also want to avoid docker (because I know docker)

# What?
I want a basic tool to interactively switch between git branches locally. Then
we'll see where it goes.

```bash
$ branch-select
> search: 
> main
> branch-1
> branch-2
> ...
```
